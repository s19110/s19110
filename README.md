- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hubert Daniszewski, this is my GitHub account, which I started during my studies in PJATK. Here I'm posting my school assignments as well as personal projects.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and image processing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP and Java Spring, as I haven't had much experience with them so far and they might prove useful to me in the future.
